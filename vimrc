" fuzzy finder: use to find fils on vim
set path+=**
" NOW WE CAN
" - Hit the <tab>  to :find by partial match
" - Use regex to make it fuzzy

" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - :b lets you autocomplete any open 

" tags: creates a tags file to find references
" tags dependes on: ctags
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .
" NOW WE CAN USE
" - use  ^] to jump to tag under cursor
" - use g^] for ambiguos tags
" - use  ^i to jump in, entering one on tag stack
" - use  ^o to jump out, backing one on tag stack
" - use  ^t to jump out, but also pop out something from the tag stack

" autocomplete: used to autocomplete based on several information, such as
" tags file, the current file, some know stuff about a certain language, ...
" NOW WE CAN
" - ^n to suggest completation based pn any know stuff
" - ^x^n to suggest from only the current file
" - ^x^] to suggest from tags file
" - ^x^f for paths names (works great with the path trick)
"
" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - use ^n and ^p to go back and forward on suggestions
" - no need to do any extra command
" - vim already know how to read tags and know some stuff about languages

" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - you can use zt to move the current line to the top with scrolloff lines
"   from the top

" NOW WE CAN CONQUER THE WORLD!
" - with much less keyword
" 
" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - the interface of the snippets is the cooler stuff
" - the nnoremap start with an n so this commnad is to be used on normal mode
" - the comma (,) is to enter command mode and execute whatever comes after
"   after :
" - the -1 is to back a line before prints the read content (so there is no
"   extra line)
" - the <CR> is to enter the command descibre above, and when in command mode
"   it executes a command it goes back to normal mode, now every thing that
"   works on normal mode works
" - 3j is to jump 3 lines
